# LLM-Demo-based-on-OLLAMA
This demo showcases a local Large Language Model (LLM) application that performs natural-language question answering and reasoning over a structured 100-item Acme office-supplies dataset stored in a CSV file. The system uses Ollama to run the LLaMA-3 model locally, ensuring no cloud dependencies or API costs.
